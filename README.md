# ML-Driven-CLV-Prediction

This repository contains the code and analysis for a machine learning project aimed at predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in an e-commerce context. The project utilizes a range of machine learning models to forecast the total revenue a business can expect from a customer throughout their relationship.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for an e-commerce business. Accurate predictions of CLV assist businesses in optimizing marketing strategies, focusing on customer retention, and efficiently allocating resources toward the most valuable customers.

### Dataset

The project is based on the "Online Retail II" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes transactional data of a UK-based online retailer from December 2009 to December 2011.

### Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand customer purchasing behavior.
- Develop predictive models for CLV and compare their performance.
- Extract actionable insights to guide marketing and business strategies.

## Models

The project explores several machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression (Baseline Model)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron)

Each model's performance is evaluated based on RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-squared metrics.
